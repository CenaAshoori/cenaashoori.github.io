This is Mohammad Hosein Ashoori, or Cena, as my friends call me, and I am an undergraduate student at Vali-e-Asr University of Rafsanjan, where I study computer engineering.

I have extensive experience with machine learning and have used it to solve a variety of problems, including detecting abnormalities in chest X-rays, detecting pneumonia in chest X-rays, and detecting abnormalities in MRI. Also, I'm really interested in signal processing and how it can be used to study the brain, so I'm trying to learn more and move up in this field.

Furthermore, in the senior year of my bachelor's, I was a teaching assistant for more than five courses, and for the following semester, I'll be a TA for two more courses that I adore, AI and Database, even though I've already graduated. Also, I've been RA for more than six months, so we're writing two papers. In one, we use an evolutionary algorithm to find communities, and in the other, we use deep learning to figure out communities by extracting features.
