Parsa KamaliPour is currently an undergraduate Computer Engineering student at the Vali-e-Asr university of Rafsanjan. The area of his major is Software Engineering.  

Heâ€™s passionate about theoretical computer science, with interests in the Design & Analysis of Algorithms, Graph Algorithms, Data Mining, Algorithmic Game Theory, Machine Learning, and so on.  

In addition to being an undergraduate research assistant, he has been a teacher assistant for more than ten courses to this day. He intends to continue his studies at the graduate level in the near future.

## Before getting into the University:

As a kid, I was curious, always asking questions to the point that everyone would get a headache!  
In elementary school, I was a top-performing student, so I got accepted to the [Governmental leading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governmental_leading_high_school) middle school, a school where only top students who pass the entrance exam will get into it.  
In high school, I was a computer enthusiast but with average grades. 

## During my first two years of university as an undergraduate student:

After taking the annual university entrance exam, I got accepted to the Vali-e-Asr University of Rafsanjan. I began my studies as a Computer Engineering major.  
I was Remarkably superb at my programming-related courses during my first two years. I was immensely passionate about programming but didn't precisely understand what I wanted to do in the future, and I didn't know how vital mathematics was. Due to that, I hardly got any good grades in my math & Science classes in my first two years of being a student.

It's worth noting that because I performed so well in my computer-related courses, our department offered me a chance to pick Software Engineering as the area of my major. Our department's software engineering is the most robust and highly competitive sub-field. Not many students get the chance to get into this area of Computer Engineering major in our school.

## After my 4th semester ended:

After my 4th semester at the school, I made several new connections with other students around Iran. I began to research and explore what I wanted to be in the future, and eventually, it came to my sense that I would like to continue my computer science studies. Indeed at first, all of this wasn't clear to me, I just had some wild guesses, but I trusted in my decisions.

Even after realizing I wanted to continue my studies, I wasn't sure which sub-field of computer science I liked. But I remembered from my 3rd semester that I absolutely enjoyed my Data Structure and Algorithms course, so I reached out to Dr. Fahimeh Dabaghi-Zarandi to become a teaching assistant for this course.

Dr. Dabaghi-Zarandi offered one of my friends and me a position to become teaching assistants for both "Data Structure and Algorithms" and "Design and Analysis of Algorithms" courses.  
We had a blast that semester being teaching assistants to lots of students. We perfectly poured our heart and soul into that job, and as a result, everyone was happy, including our students, ourselves, and Dr. Dabaghi-Zarandi.

## A new chapter in my life just began:

Dr. Dabaghi-Zarandi reached out to me to offer us the position of Teaching Assistant once again, and we were more than happy to accept.  
At that moment, it struck me that I am immensely passionate about theoretical computer science, and I would love to continue my academic journey in the field of Algorithms. So again, I reached out to Dr. Dabaghi-Zarandi, asking her if she had any available position as Undergraduate Research Assistant for me. Thankfully she gave me a chance, and ultimately, I was selected to be her undergrad research assistant. We began our research on algorithms related to Community Detection immediately.

In the third year of my studies, I realized how vital my courses and my academic journey were to me; thus, every single semester after my 4th semester, I studied as hard as I could to absorb as much knowledge as I could and get the best grades that I ever had.  
And because of doing so, when I was in my 8th semester, I ranked 6th among all computer engineering students of Vali-e-Asr university that started their studies in 2018.

In my 8th semester, I was honored to be a Teaching Assistant of Dr. Mojtaba Sabbagh-Jafari for the Intro to Information Retrieval course.

And in the summer after that, I had the honor to collaborate in teaching with Dr. Amir Hossein Hadjahmadi. In my 9th semester, I am thrilled to be Dr. Hadjahmadi's Teaching Assistant, Dr. Sabbagh-Jafari's, and Dr. Dabaghi-Zarandi's.

 Also, I am happy to announce That my first paper has been published in the Journal of Network and Computer Applications, a Q1 journal with a 7.574 Impact Factor and 15.7 CiteScore. [[doi]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnca.2022.103492)

My friends and I are working on two new papers under the supervision of Dr. Fahimeh Dabaghi-Zarandi.

In the summer of 2022, Vali-e-Asr University Scientific Association of Computer Engineering held the most extensive online event in our department, The Summer Coding Bootcamp. And I'm proud to be part of it, I have helped the crew to make it happen, and I'm one of the instructors of this coding Bootcamp. in this Bootcamp, I teach Python and its popular packages, Git, and GitHub.

From the beginning of my 9th semester, I'm pleased to announce that I will be the Head of the Teaching Assistant Committee at Vali-e-Asr University Scientific Association of Computer Engineering.  
My job is to be a bridge between remarkable students and professors, nominate and introduce qualified Teaching Assistants for each course to professors, accumulate a great team of TAs per course, and give my experiences to new TAs and train them to be an accomplished teaching assistants.
