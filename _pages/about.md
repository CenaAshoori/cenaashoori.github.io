Parsa KamaliPour is currently an undergraduate student of computer engineering at Vali-e-Asr university of Rafsanjan. His major focus is software engineering. Heâ€™s passionate about theoretical computer science, with interests in algorithm design, game theory, randomized algorithms, community detection, graph theory, and so on. In addition to being an undergraduate research assistant, he has been a teacher assistant for more than five courses to this day. He intends to continue his studies at the graduate level in the near future.

## Before getting into the University:

As a kid, I was curious, always asking questions to the point that everyone would get a headache!  
In elementary school, I was a top-performing student, so I got accepted to the [Governmental leading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governmental_leading_high_school) middle school, a school where only top students who pass the entrance exam will get into it.  
In high school, I was a computer enthusiast but with average grades. 

## During my first two years of university as an undergraduate student:

After taking the annual university entrance exam, I got accepted to the Vali-e-Asr University of Rafsanjan.  
I was Remarkably superb at my programming-related courses during my first two years. I was immensely passionate about programming but didn't precisely understand what I wanted to do in the future, and I didn't know how vital mathematics was. Due to that, I hardly got any good grades in my math & Science classes in my first two years of being a student.

## After my 4th semester ended:

After my 4th semester at the school, I made several new connections with other students around Iran. I began to research and explore what I wanted to be in the future, and eventually, it came to my sense that I would like to continue my computer science studies. Indeed at first, all of this wasn't clear to me, I just had some wild guesses, but I trusted in my decisions.

Even after realizing I wanted to continue my studies, I wasn't sure which sub-field of computer science I liked. But I remembered from my 3rd semester that I absolutely enjoyed my Data Structure and Algorithms course, so I reached out to Dr. Fahimeh Dabaghi-Zarandi to become a teaching assistant for this course.

Dr. Dabaghi-Zarandi offered one of my friends and me a position to become teaching assistants for both "Data Structure and Algorithms" and "Design and Analysis of Algorithms" courses.  
We had a blast that semester being teaching assistants to lots of students. We perfectly poured our heart and soul into that job, and as a result, everyone was happy, including our students, ourselves, and Dr. Dabaghi-Zarandi.
