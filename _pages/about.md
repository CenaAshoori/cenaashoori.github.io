He’s passionate about theoretical computer science, with interests in algorithm design, game theory, randomized algorithms, community detection, graph theory, and so on. In addition to being an undergraduate research assistant, he has been a teacher assistant for more than five courses to this day. He intends to continue his studies at the graduate level in the near future.

### About me

I was born in Rafsanjan, but we moved one year after that to Kerman. As a kid, I was a curious one, always asking questions to the point that everyone would get a headache! In elementary school, I was a top-performing student, and due to that, I got accepted to the [Governmental leading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governmental_leading_high_school) middle school, a school that only top students who pass the entrance exam will get into it. In high school, I had to deal with some things that left me traumatized, and due to that, I failed to be the student I always was. Eventually, I got accepted into the Vali-e-Asr University of Rafsanjan. I began my studies as a computer engineering student. Even though I performed exceptionally well in my programming classes, I was lost, and I didn’t know what I wanted to be in the computer science field. After a couple of semesters, I was lucky to find some good friends. Besides that, I became a Teaching Assistant for the data structures and design and analysis of algorithms course, which made me realize I’m really passionate about this stuff, so I kept becoming a TA. After a while, I decided to be a research assistant as well, and to be honest; I have never been this much happy with my life. Quickly I realized I was born to work in academia.
