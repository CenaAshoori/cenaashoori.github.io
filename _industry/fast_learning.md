You can transform any educational material such as books,
notes, podcasts or any other thing into a flashcard, and by the
help of our intelligent algorithm transfers it to your long-term
memory so you will never ever forget it.
Flash cards can include questions, answers and additional explanations along with audio files, photos, video links. A strong text editor is also at your disposal so that you can make more attractive flash cards. You can put flash cards in various lessons and books and for each lesson, you can put additional educational content tests and many other things. You also have the ability to convert text to speech with support for 9 languages.
(English, French, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, Japanese, Chinese, Turkish)
while you're exercising, walking, driving, gardening, or many
other things, you are learning too and lead the data to your
long-term memory.
While the others are wasting their time and can’t spend their
time efficiently, at the same time you are learning more and
more, improving your knowledge, and spending your extra time
on your favorite activities that you couldn’t do before because
you had no time to do them. You can easily share the
flashcards with teachers, students, and friends and boost the
speed and the quality of education.
Generating educational content, selling to others, and earning
money with our app is piece of cake. Once and for all Learn,
teach, and make money! The experience that you haven’t had
before.
