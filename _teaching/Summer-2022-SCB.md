The Vali-e-Asr University Scientific Association of Computer Engineering's biggest online event, the Summer Coding Bootcamp, took place in the summer of 2022. 
It was my honor to be one of the instructors for the bootcamp.
- [My Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8lkRTN9WFf4FrCTR04sXVA)
- [Our Aparat channel](https://www.aparat.com/computer_vru)

During this bootcamp, I teach some of the important concepts that everyone will encounter during developing Django and Flutter apps.
